<div class="faq">Where'd it go?</div>
<blockquote>
The site is currently disabled (as of January 2017). After a good run of 7 years, I don't have resources to host or maintain the site. This page will stay up for anyone seeking information about the methods used on the site for machine-learning and chaotic-dynamics assisted course setting.

<div class="faq">What is (was) this?</div>
<blockquote>
This is an attempt to <strong style="color: brown;">use computers to assist in setting indoor rock climbing routes</strong>. More specifically, have a few questions:
<ul>
 <li>Can computer software aid in setting routes (i.e., as an "idea generator")?
 <li>Would (expert) route setters appreciate this assistance?
 <li>Can climbers tell the difference (positively or negatively) between routes set with computer help?
</ul>
We've carried out a pilot study along with a larger experiment to this effect, and found that the software can help and that
<strong style="color: brown;">climbers in some cases <em>prefer</em> the routes it sets</strong>! 
<br><br>
This website is an attempt to build a community around this process.
The idea is that if anyone can use the tool, maybe we can learn how to make it better by getting direct feedback from the climbing
community as well as provide some opportunities for setters to collaborate with each other.

<div class="faq">How does it work?</div>

The details of our experiments and algorithms are all described in <a href="http://scholar.colorado.edu/csci_techreports/1017/">this
technical report</a>. It should answer just about all your questions, and then some. Here are the two academic publiations that feature Strange Beta. Please cite them if you use or reference the work:
